## Current Flow

1. **Upload Video** → Supabase Storage + Gemini (with fallback)
2. **AI Analysis** → Segments detected with categories
3. **Editor View** → Choose between Groups or Traditional view
4. **Make Edits** → Select/deselect segments, choose takes
5. **Export/Render** → EDL/FCPXML/Premiere or Chillin render
6. **Download Result** → Get edited video or edit list

## Fixed Issues

1. ✅ Time parsing now handles both string ("1:30") and number (90) formats
2. ✅ Export functions work with mixed time formats
3. ✅ Render uses pre-uploaded Supabase URL (no duplicate uploads)
4. ✅ Enhanced analysis fallback for large files
5. ✅ All buttons in FinalReviewPanel are functional
