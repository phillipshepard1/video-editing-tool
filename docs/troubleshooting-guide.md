# Video Processing Troubleshooting Guide

## Quick Diagnostic Steps

Before diving into specific issues, try these quick diagnostic steps:

1. **Refresh the page** and try again
2. **Clear browser cache** (Ctrl+Shift+Delete / Cmd+Shift+Delete)
3. **Close other browser tabs** to free memory
4. **Check browser console** for error messages (F12 â†’ Console)
5. **Try a different browser** (Chrome, Firefox, Edge)

## Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. Upload Issues

#### "File too large" Error
**Problem**: Video file exceeds 5GB limit

**Solutions**:
- Compress video using external tool before upload
- Split long video into shorter segments
- Use lower resolution version for analysis
- Try uploading different sections separately

**Prevention**:
- Check file size before upload
- Use efficient video formats (MP4, WebM)
- Avoid uncompressed formats (AVI, MOV from some cameras)

#### "Invalid file format" Error
**Problem**: Video format not supported

**Supported formats**: MP4, MOV, AVI, MKV, WebM

**Solutions**:
- Convert video to MP4 format
- Check file extension matches actual format
- Ensure file isn't corrupted
- Try re-exporting from original source

**Format-specific issues**:
- **AVI**: Some codecs not supported
- **MOV**: iPhone/Mac videos usually work, others may not
- **MKV**: Usually supported but can be complex
- **WebM**: Well supported
- **MP4**: Most reliable format

#### Upload Stops or Fails
**Problem**: Upload process interrupts or fails

**Solutions**:
1. **Check internet connection**
   - Ensure stable connection
   - Avoid uploading on mobile data
   - Try wired connection if possible

2. **Browser issues**
   - Disable browser extensions temporarily
   - Clear browser cache and cookies
   - Try incognito/private browsing mode
   - Update browser to latest version

3. **Device issues**
   - Ensure sufficient free storage space
   - Close other applications using memory
   - Check device temperature (overheating can cause issues)

### 2. Processing Errors

#### "Out of Memory" Error
**Problem**: Browser runs out of memory during processing

**Immediate solutions**:
1. **Free up memory**
   - Close all other browser tabs
   - Close other applications
   - Restart browser
   - Restart computer if necessary

2. **Reduce processing load**
   - Lower quality settings (use "Low" quality)
   - Enable chunked processing
   - Reduce video resolution
   - Use faster preset (ultrafast/fast)

**Long-term solutions**:
- Upgrade device RAM (8GB+ recommended)
- Use desktop computer instead of mobile device
- Process videos during low-usage times

**Technical details**:
- Browser memory limit typically 2-4GB
- 4K videos require significantly more memory
- Complex videos (lots of motion/effects) use more memory

#### "Processing Timeout" Error
**Problem**: Video processing takes too long and times out

**Common causes**:

- High resolution videos (4K+)
- Complex video content
- Slow device performance

**Solutions**:
1. **Reduce complexity**
   - Lower video resolution
   - Use faster processing preset
   - Reduce target quality

2. **Split processing**
   - Process video in shorter segments
   - Enable automatic chunking
   - Export smaller portions separately

3. **System optimization**
   - Close unnecessary applications
   - Ensure adequate cooling
   - Use desktop computer for large files

#### "FFmpeg Initialization Failed" Error
**Problem**: Video processing engine fails to start

**Browser requirements**:
- WebAssembly support
- SharedArrayBuffer support (optional but recommended)
- Modern browser (Chrome 80+, Firefox 80+, Edge 80+)

**Solutions**:
1. **Update browser**
   - Use latest version of Chrome, Firefox, or Edge
   - Enable WebAssembly in browser settings
   - Clear browser cache

2. **Browser settings**

- Audio-only files

**Solutions**:
1. **Check video file**
   - Ensure video plays in standard media player
   - Verify video has both audio and video tracks
   - Check for file corruption

2. **Format conversion**
   - Convert to standard MP4 format
   - Use common codecs (H.264 video, AAC audio)
   - Re-encode if necessary

3. **Fallback options**
   - Skip AI analysis and process manually
   - Use default editing settings
   - Process shorter segments individually

#### Inaccurate Analysis Results
**Problem**: AI suggestions are not helpful or wrong

**Improving accuracy**:
1. **Better instructions**
   - Provide more specific custom instructions
   - Describe the video type (tutorial, interview, etc.)
   - Explain what content to keep/remove

2. **Quality settings**
   - Use higher quality for analysis
   - Ensure good audio quality
