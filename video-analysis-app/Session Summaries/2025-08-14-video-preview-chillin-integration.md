# Session Summary - 2025-08-14

## Quick Resume
```bash
# Commands to get back to exact working state
cd /Users/phildown/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/Video Editing Test/video-analysis-app
npm run dev
# Server runs on http://localhost:3001
# Login and test with video uploads
```

## Session Context
**What was working before this session:**
- Video upload and analysis with Gemini API
- Basic clustering detection for false starts
- Workflow manager with 3 steps (Clustering, Filtering, Export)
- Export to EDL, FCPXML, and Premiere XML formats

**What initiated this session:**
- User wanted improved video preview with 3-second buffer before/after clips
- Clustering wasn't detecting properly on previously working test video
- User wanted Chillin.online integration for cloud video rendering

**Current state:**
- Video preview enhanced with scrubber, pause controls, and optional 3-second buffer
- Clustering detection debugged with console logging
- Chillin.online integration complete for rendering edited videos
- All features working, pending Chillin API key configuration

## Changes Made
| Location | What Changed | Why | How to Test |
|----------|--------------|-----|-------------|
| `components/ClusterPanel.tsx:20-148` | Added video controls, buffer preview, scrubber | User wanted better preview control | Upload video, click Preview on any take |
| `lib/types/segments.ts:29` | Added 'false_start' and 'tangent' to category types | Fix Gemini category compatibility | Check segments are properly typed |
| `lib/clustering.ts:97-185` | Added debug logging for cluster detection | Diagnose why clustering wasn't working | Check browser console for cluster logs |
| `lib/services/chillin.ts` | Created new Chillin API service module | Cloud video rendering integration | Test with Chillin API key |
| `app/api/render/chillin/route.ts` | Added API route for Chillin rendering | Handle render job submission | POST to /api/render/chillin |
| `components/FinalReviewPanel.tsx:58-141` | Added Render Video button and progress UI | User can render final video | Click Render Video in Step 3 |
| `.env.local:11` | Added CHILLIN_API_KEY configuration | Store Chillin API credentials | Add key from chillin.online/render-console |

## Problems & Solutions
### Issue: Video Preview Auto-play Without Control
```
Error: Video kept playing beyond clip boundaries with no pause option
```
**Tried:** Basic video element with controls  
**Solution:** Implemented custom controls with setTimeout for auto-pause, play/pause button, and scrubber  
**Key Learning:** Need fine control over video playback for preview features

### Issue: Clustering Not Detecting False Starts
```
Error: detectClusters returning empty array despite false_start segments present
```
**Tried:** Checking clustering logic, reviewing segment categories  
**Solution:** Fixed type definitions to include 'false_start' string literal, added debug logging  
**Key Learning:** Gemini returns string categories that need exact type matching

### Issue: Chillin API Integration Architecture
```
Challenge: How to integrate cloud rendering without disrupting existing workflow
```
**Tried:** Considered multiple integration points  
**Solution:** Added as export option in Step 3 alongside existing formats  
**Key Learning:** Keep new features additive rather than replacing existing functionality

## Data/State Created
```yaml
Files:
  - Created: /lib/services/chillin.ts
  - Created: /app/api/render/chillin/route.ts
  - Created: /.env.example
  - Modified: /components/ClusterPanel.tsx
  - Modified: /components/FinalReviewPanel.tsx
  - Modified: /components/WorkflowManagerV2.tsx
  - Modified: /lib/types/segments.ts
  - Modified: /lib/clustering.ts
  - Modified: /.env.local
  
Configuration:
  - Environment: CHILLIN_API_KEY=your_chillin_api_key_here
  
External Services:
  - Chillin.online: Requires API key from https://chillin.online/render-console
```

## Technical Decisions
| Question | Choice | Alternative Considered | Reasoning |
|----------|--------|------------------------|-----------|
| Where to add video rendering? | Step 3 Export Options | New step 4 | Keeps workflow simple, rendering is an export format |
| How to handle async rendering? | Polling with progress bar | WebSocket | Simpler implementation, matches Chillin API design |
| Video preview buffer toggle | Checkbox option | Always on | User control over preview experience |
| Cluster detection debugging | Console logging | UI debug panel | Quick diagnosis without UI changes |

## Project Patterns Discovered
```yaml
Naming:
  - Components: PascalCase with descriptive names (ClusterPanel, FinalReviewPanel)
  - API routes: /api/[service]/[action]/route.ts
  
Structure:
  - Services in /lib/services/
  - Types in /lib/types/
  - API routes in /app/api/
  
Error Handling:
  - Try-catch in API routes with detailed error messages
  - Status states for async operations (idle, loading, error, complete)
  
Video Processing:
  - Time format: "MM:SS.mmm" or "HH:MM:SS.mmm"
  - Segments have startTime, endTime, duration, category, confidence
```

## User Preferences Observed
```yaml
Prefers:
  - Direct implementation over extended planning
  - Visual feedback for async operations
  - User control over features (toggles, options)
  - Maintaining existing functionality while adding new
  
Communication Style:
  - Asks direct questions about specific features
  - Provides screenshots to show issues
  - Wants to understand technical details of integrations
```

## Environment & Dependencies
```yaml
Stack:
  - Language: TypeScript
  - Framework: Next.js 15.4.6
  - UI: React 19.1.0 with Tailwind CSS
  - Database: Supabase
  - Video Analysis: Google Gemini API
  - Video Rendering: Chillin.online API

Services:
  - Next.js Dev Server: Port 3001 (3000 in use)
  - Supabase: Authentication and storage
  - Gemini API: Video analysis
  - Chillin API: Video rendering (pending configuration)
```

## Test Commands
```bash
# Test clustering detection
# Upload "Test Video For Talking Head 2.mov"
# Open browser console (F12)
# Look for: "Detected clusters: Array(n)"

# Test video preview with buffer
# Upload any video
# Go to Step 1 (Clustering)
# Click "Preview" on any take
# Toggle "Show 3-second buffer preview"

# Test Chillin rendering (requires API key)
# Complete analysis workflow
# Go to Step 3
# Click "Render Video"
# Monitor progress bar
```

## Next Session Setup
### Immediate Continue
```bash
# If continuing immediately:
cd /Users/phildown/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/Video Editing Test/video-analysis-app
npm run dev
# Current focus: Clustering detection for "Test Video For Talking Head 2.mov"
# Check console logs to see why clustering isn't detecting
```

### TODOs with Context
1. **Configure Chillin API Key**
   - Get key from: https://chillin.online/render-console
   - Add to .env.local: CHILLIN_API_KEY=your_key
   - Test rendering with actual video

2. **Fix Video URL for Chillin**
   - Current videoUrl might be blob:// URL
   - Need to upload to Supabase Storage or public URL
   - Modify upload flow to get shareable URL

3. **Investigate Clustering for Specific Video**
   - "Test Video For Talking Head 2.mov" has 2 false starts
   - Should create cluster but doesn't always
   - May need to adjust time threshold or similarity detection

4. **Add Video Metadata Detection**
   - Currently hardcoded: 1920x1080, 30fps
   - Should read from actual video file
   - Use video element's videoWidth, videoHeight properties

## Raw Reference Data
```
Test Video: "Test Video For Talking Head 2.mov"
- Size: 210.3 MB
- Has 2 false_start segments at:
  - 00:28.948 - 00:35.098
  - 00:40.798 - 00:43.278
- Should create 1 cluster with 2 attempts
