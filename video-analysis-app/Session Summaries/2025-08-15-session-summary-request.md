## Session Context
**What was working before this session:**
- Video analysis application with Gemini integration
- Multiple processing workflows and mockups
- Session summaries documentation system

**What initiated this session:**
- User requested creation of a session summary using a specific template format

**Current state:**
- Session summary template successfully implemented
- Documentation system enhanced with standardized format

## Changes Made
| Location | What Changed | Why | How to Test |
|----------|--------------|-----|-------------|
| `Session Summaries/2025-08-15-session-summary-request.md` | Created new session summary file | User requested session documentation | File exists and contains template |

## Problems & Solutions
### Issue: Session Documentation Request
```
Request: Create session summary with specific template format
```
**Tried:** N/A - Direct implementation  
**Solution:** Created markdown file using provided template structure  
**Key Learning:** User has established documentation patterns for session tracking

## Data/State Created
```yaml
Files:
  - Created: Session Summaries/2025-08-15-session-summary-request.md
  
Configuration:
  - Session summary template implemented
```

## Technical Decisions
| Question | Choice | Alternative Considered | Reasoning |
|----------|--------|------------------------|-----------|
| File location | Session Summaries folder | Root directory | Existing folder structure maintained |
| Template usage | Full template implementation | Minimal summary | User provided comprehensive template |

## Project Patterns Discovered
```yaml
Structure:
  - Session documentation: Stored in dedicated Session Summaries folder
  - Naming convention: YYYY-MM-DD-descriptive-name.md format
  
Documentation:
  - Comprehensive templates: Include technical details and quick resume sections
  - Context preservation: Track working state and environment setup
```

## User Preferences Observed
```yaml
Prefers:
  - Structured documentation: Detailed templates for session tracking
  - Organized file structure: Dedicated folders for different content types
  
Communication Style:
  - Direct requests: Clear specification of desired outcomes
  - Template-based: Preference for standardized formats
```

## Environment & Dependencies
```yaml
Stack:
  - Platform: macOS (Darwin 24.6.0)
  - Working Directory: Video Editing Test project
  - Repository: Not a git repository

Current Session:
  - Duration: Brief documentation task
  - Tools Used: File creation and directory listing
```

## Test Commands
```bash
# Command 1: Verify file creation
ls "Session Summaries/"
# Expected: File 2025-08-15-session-summary-request.md should be listed

# Command 2: Check file content
cat "Session Summaries/2025-08-15-session-summary-request.md"
# Expected: Complete session summary with template structure
```

## Next Session Setup
### Immediate Continue
```bash
# If continuing immediately, run:
cd "/Users/phildown/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/Video Editing Test/video-analysis-app"
# Current work is in: Documentation/Session tracking
# Next step: Continue with video analysis application development
```

### TODOs with Context
1. **Continue Video Analysis Development**
   - Approach: Build on existing application structure
   - Files to modify: Based on next user requirements
   - Gotchas: Maintain existing session documentation patterns
   - Reference: Previous session summaries in same folder

## Raw Reference Data

Template Provided: Comprehensive session summary format
```
