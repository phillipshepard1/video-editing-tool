# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
# Smart Filtering System for AI Video Editor

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** January 12, 2025  
**Author:** Product Team  
**Status:** Planning Phase

---

## 1. Executive Summary

### 1.1 Product Vision
Transform the AI video editing experience from an overwhelming list of cuts to an intelligent, context-aware filtering system that respects editorial intent while maintaining efficiency.

### 1.2 Problem Statement
Current AI video editing tools present all potential cuts equally, overwhelming users with decisions and failing to distinguish between critical edits (bad takes, technical issues) and stylistic choices (redundancy for emphasis, personality-adding tangents). Users need a system that prioritizes what matters while keeping optional edits accessible.

### 1.3 Solution Overview
A hierarchical filtering system that:
- Shows critical cuts by default (bad takes, pauses, false starts)
- Hides contextual cuts initially (redundancy, tangents)
- Allows granular control over what to include/exclude
- Provides context for why cuts are suggested
- Enables bulk actions by category

---

## 2. Goals and Success Metrics

### 2.1 Primary Goals
1. **Reduce cognitive load** by 60% through smart defaults
2. **Increase editing speed** by 40% through categorical filtering
3. **Improve user satisfaction** with editorial control
4. **Maintain video quality** while respecting creative intent

### 2.2 Success Metrics
| Metric | Current | Target | Measurement |
|--------|---------|--------|-------------|
| Time to first export | 15 min | 9 min | Analytics |
| Segments reviewed per minute | 3 | 5 | User tracking |
| User override rate | 35% | 20% | Edit tracking |
| Feature adoption rate | N/A | 80% | Usage analytics |
| User satisfaction (NPS) | N/A | >8/10 | Surveys |

### 2.3 Non-Goals
- Automatic editing without user review
- Removing all user control
- Making decisions that require creative judgment
- Processing video on the server side

## 9. Testing Strategy

### 9.1 User Testing Scenarios
1. **Overwhelm Test:** Present 100+ cuts, measure time to first action
2. **Accuracy Test:** Compare user selections with/without categories
3. **Speed Test:** Time to review 50 segments with/without filters
4. **Satisfaction Test:** Survey on confidence in decisions

### 9.2 A/B Testing
- Control: Current "show all cuts" approach
- Variant A: Smart filters with defaults
- Variant B: Smart filters with onboarding tutorial
- Metrics: Time to export, segments reviewed, user satisfaction

### 9.3 Edge Cases
- Videos with only technical issues (no content cuts)
- Videos with 500+ potential cuts
- Users who want to see everything
- Videos where "redundant" content is critical

---

## 10. Risks and Mitigations

### 10.1 Risk: Over-filtering hides important cuts
**Mitigation:** Clear indication of hidden cuts, easy toggle, undo functionality

### 10.2 Risk: Category detection inaccuracy
**Mitigation:** Confidence scores, user feedback loop, manual recategorization

### 10.3 Risk: Increased complexity
**Mitigation:** Progressive disclosure, smart defaults, onboarding flow

### 10.4 Risk: Performance with many filters
**Mitigation:** Efficient filtering algorithms, virtualized lists, caching
