# Session Summary - January 14, 2025

## Quick Resume
```bash
# Commands to get back to exact working state
cd "/Users/phildown/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/Video Editing Test/video-analysis-app"
npm run dev
# Verify working: http://localhost:3000
```

## Session Context
**What was working before this session:**
- Complex browser-based video processing pipeline with FFmpeg.wasm
- Hybrid architecture with Vercel hosting and browser chunking
- Multiple PRDs documenting extensive features

**What initiated this session:**
User returned after a break with "i am back" and reported "http://localhost:3000/ just spins..." - the dev server was hanging/not loading.

**Current state:**
- ✅ Original Gemini video analysis fully functional
- ✅ Video preview with 5-second context window working
- ✅ Three-column layout (filters, segments, preview)
- ❌ Browser-based video processing disabled (causes 104+ second compilation)
- ✅ Fast compilation (~400ms instead of 104+ seconds)

## Changes Made
| Location | What Changed | Why | How to Test |
|----------|--------------|-----|-------------|
| `app/page.tsx:10-26` | Commented out heavy video-processing imports | Causing 104+ second compilation time | Check compilation speed on npm run dev |
| `app/page.tsx:entire` | Restored original Gemini analysis functionality | Get core features working without browser processing | Upload video and analyze |
| `app/page.tsx:234-309` | Added video preview with context window | User requested preview with 5s before/after | Click any segment to see preview |
| `app/page.tsx:279-309` | Fixed navigation logic for Previous/Next | Glitches in segment navigation | Test Previous/Next buttons |
| `app/page.tsx:59-69` | Added proper video URL management | Prevent memory leaks from multiple createObjectURL | Check browser memory usage |

## Problems & Solutions
### Issue: Dev Server Hanging
```
Error: Page loads forever, spinner never stops
Next.js compilation taking 104+ seconds
```
**Tried:** 
- Killed orphaned processes (PID 46211)
- Checked for port conflicts on 3000
  
**Solution:** 
- Commented out heavy imports from `@/lib/video-processing`
- These imports were loading FFmpeg.wasm and causing massive bundle size
  
**Key Learning:** Dynamic imports or code splitting needed for heavy libraries

### Issue: Video Preview Glitches
```
Error: Previous/Next navigation not working correctly
Memory leaks from multiple URL.createObjectURL() calls
```
**Tried:** 
- Direct index tracking
  
**Solution:** 
- Fixed navigation to track position in filtered segments
- Created single video URL on file change with proper cleanup
  
**Key Learning:** Always revoke object URLs and track filtered vs full arrays carefully

## Data/State Created
```yaml
Files:
  - Created: /Session Summaries/2025-01-14-video-analysis-restoration.md
  - Modified: app/page.tsx (simplified from 1794 to 864 lines)
  - Backup: app/page-backup.tsx (contains note about temporary replacement)
  
Configuration:
  - GEMINI_API_KEY: AIzaSyDaIgw7bCy6uaM2K7TRX9HWx56gt0XOxy0
  - Model: gemini-2.5-pro
  
External Services:
  - Gemini API: Using 2.5 Pro for video analysis
  - Pricing: ~$3.125 per 1M tokens average
```

## Technical Decisions
| Question | Choice | Alternative Considered | Reasoning |
|----------|--------|------------------------|-----------|
| Handle slow compilation | Comment out heavy imports | Dynamic imports | Quick fix to get app working immediately |
| Video preview approach | 5-second context window | Full video preview | Shows cut in context as user requested |
| Layout structure | 3-column (filters/segments/preview) | 2-column layout | User specifically requested this arrangement |
| Gemini model | 2.5 Pro | Earlier versions | Best quality for video analysis |

## Project Patterns Discovered
```yaml
Naming:
  - Segments: segment-{index} for IDs
  - Categories: Old format (pause, filler) vs new enums (SegmentCategory.PAUSE)
  
Structure:
  - API routes: /api/analysis/[action]/route.ts
  - Components: /components/[ComponentName].tsx
  - Lib functions: /lib/[feature]/[module].ts
  
Error Handling:
  - Parse JSON from markdown blocks when Gemini returns formatted responses
  - Fallback parsing for different response formats
  
Video Processing:
  - Server-side: Gemini API for analysis
  - Client-side: Preview and playback only (heavy processing disabled)
```

## User Preferences Observed
```yaml
Prefers:
  - Visual feedback: Progress bars for uploads/analysis
  - Clear layout: Three distinct columns for workflow
  - Context in previews: 5 seconds before/after cuts
  
Communication Style:
  - Direct problem reporting: "just spins..."
  - Asks for confirmation: "is this full function still?"
  - Visual references: Provides screenshots for UI requests
```

## Environment & Dependencies
```yaml
Stack:
  - Language: TypeScript/JavaScript
  - Framework: Next.js 14 (App Router)
  - UI: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
  - Database: None (client-side only currently)
  - Key Libraries: 
    - @google/generative-ai (Gemini SDK)
    - lucide-react (icons)
    - Video processing libs (temporarily disabled)

Services:
  - Next.js dev: Port 3000 - Main application
  
Disabled Dependencies:
  - @ffmpeg/ffmpeg - Browser video processing
  - @ffmpeg/util - FFmpeg utilities
  - idb - IndexedDB wrapper
```

## Test Commands
```bash
# Command 1: Test dev server startup
npm run dev
# Expected: Compilation in <1 second, app loads at http://localhost:3000

# Command 2: Test video analysis
# Upload any MP4 video file via UI
# Expected: Upload to Gemini, analysis returns segments to remove

# Command 3: Check for orphaned processes
ps aux | grep -E "next-server" | grep -v grep
# Expected: No results (all killed)
```

## Next Session Setup
### Immediate Continue
```bash
# If continuing immediately, run:
cd "/Users/phildown/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/Video Editing Test/video-analysis-app"
npm run dev
# Current work is in: app/page.tsx
# Next step: Consider implementing dynamic imports for video-processing library
```

### TODOs with Context
1. **Restore Browser Processing with Dynamic Imports**
   - Approach: Use Next.js dynamic() for heavy components
   - Files to modify: app/page.tsx, create new lazy-loaded wrapper
   - Gotchas: Ensure SSR is disabled for browser-only APIs
   - Reference: `const VideoProcessor = dynamic(() => import('@/lib/video-processing'), { ssr: false })`

2. **Optimize Video Preview Performance**
   - Current: Creates new URL each time
   - Improve: Cache video URLs per file
   - Consider: WebWorker for timeline calculations

3. **Add Gemini API Error Recovery**
   - Handle quota limits gracefully
   - Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
   - Add user-friendly error messages

*Key for next session: Look at "Quick Resume" first, then check if browser processing needs to be re-enabled with dynamic imports*
