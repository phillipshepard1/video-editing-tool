# Session Summary - 2025-08-15

## Quick Resume
```bash
# Commands to get back to exact working state
cd "/Users/phildown/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/Video Editing Test/video-analysis-app"
npm run dev
# Verify working: http://localhost:3000
# Next: Go to Supabase dashboard to create storage buckets
```

## Session Context
**What was working before this session:**
- Video analysis application with Gemini integration
- Video upload and analysis functionality
- Rendering workflow for small files (<50MB)

**What initiated this session:**
- User reported 5 React errors in console logs
- Video rendering was redirecting to example.com/mock-video.mp4 for large files
- Investigation revealed 413 "Request Entity Too Large" errors

**Current state:**
- React key errors fixed ✅
- Identified root cause: Wrong Chillin API endpoint usage
- Switched to URL-based rendering to bypass file size limits ✅
- Discovered critical Supabase storage bucket configuration issues
- MCP Supabase integration configured ✅

## Changes Made
| Location | What Changed | Why | How to Test |
|----------|--------------|-----|-------------|
| `components/FinalReviewPanel.tsx:385` | Fixed React key duplication | Eliminate console errors | Check browser console |
| `components/FinalReviewPanel.tsx:72-106` | Switched to URL-based rendering only | Bypass 50MB upload limits | Test large file rendering |
| `app/api/render/chillin/route.ts:102` | Updated mock error message | Better user feedback | Attempt render without storage |
| `lib/video-upload.ts:37-89` | Enhanced bucket fallback logic | Handle missing buckets gracefully | Upload video file |
| `supabase/fix-storage-buckets.sql` | Created bucket setup script | Fix critical storage issues | Run SQL in dashboard |
| `.mcp.json` | Added MCP Supabase config | Enable direct DB management | Restart Claude Code |

## Problems & Solutions
### Issue: React Key Duplication Errors
```
Error: Encountered two children with the same key, 'segment-1'. Keys should be unique so that components maintain their identity across updates.
```
**Tried:** Reviewing console logs and component structure  
**Solution:** Changed `key={segment.id}` to `key={`${segment.id}-${index}`}` for unique keys  
**Key Learning:** Always use unique keys when mapping arrays, especially with potential duplicates

### Issue: Large File Rendering Fails
```
Error: 413 Request Entity Too Large - nginx/1.24.0
```
**Tried:** Increasing Next.js body parser limits, file compression warnings  
**Solution:** Switched from direct file upload (`/render/video`) to URL-based API (`/render/v1`)  
**Key Learning:** External APIs may have multiple endpoints with different capabilities

### Issue: Mock Fallback Redirects to Example.com
```
Error: Render service unavailable, returning mock render ID with example.com URL
```
**Tried:** Error message improvements  
**Solution:** Changed mock response to return proper error instead of fake download URL  
**Key Learning:** Mock responses should fail gracefully, not create confusing user experiences

### Issue: Missing Supabase Storage Buckets
```
Error: {"statusCode":"404","error":"Bucket not found","message":"Bucket not found"}
```
**Tried:** API testing and configuration review  
**Solution:** Created comprehensive SQL script to set up buckets with correct permissions  
**Key Learning:** Cloud storage requires explicit bucket creation and public access for external APIs

## Data/State Created
```yaml
Database:
  - Supabase storage buckets: Pending creation (videos, public)
  
Files:
  - Created: supabase/fix-storage-buckets.sql
  - Created: .mcp.json (MCP configuration)
  - Modified: components/FinalReviewPanel.tsx
  - Modified: lib/video-upload.ts
  - Modified: app/api/render/chillin/route.ts
  
Configuration:
  - MCP Server: Supabase integration with personal access token
  - Storage: Public bucket configuration for external API access
  
External Services:
  - Chillin API: Using URL-based endpoint for large files
  - Supabase: Personal access token configured
```

## Technical Decisions
| Question | Choice | Alternative Considered | Reasoning |
|----------|--------|------------------------|-----------|
| File upload approach | URL-based via Supabase | Direct upload to Chillin | Bypasses nginx upload limits completely |
| Bucket permissions | Public buckets | Private with signed URLs | External APIs need simple URL access |
| Error handling | Fail with clear message | Redirect to mock URLs | Better user experience and debugging |
| MCP integration | Project-scoped .mcp.json | User-scoped configuration | Shareable with team via version control |

## Project Patterns Discovered
```yaml
Structure:
  - API routes: Separate direct upload vs URL-based endpoints
  - Storage: Multi-bucket fallback strategy
  - Error handling: Mock responses for service unavailability
  
Testing:
  - External API testing: curl commands for quick validation
  - Storage testing: Direct bucket access verification
  
Configuration:
  - MCP servers: Project-level .mcp.json files
  - Environment variables: Supabase URLs and tokens in .env.local
```

## User Preferences Observed
```yaml
Prefers:
  - Clear documentation: Detailed session summaries
  - Root cause analysis: Deep investigation of issues
  - Systematic fixes: Address underlying problems, not symptoms
  
Communication Style:
  - Direct questions: "what do we need to do go beyond 50mb limit?"
  - Problem-focused: Shows screenshots of actual errors
  - Solution-oriented: Wants working implementations
```

## Environment & Dependencies
```yaml
Stack:
  - Platform: macOS Darwin 24.6.0
  - Runtime: Next.js 15.4.6
  - Database: Supabase (leeslkgwtmgfewsbxwyu.supabase.co)
  - Storage: Supabase Storage API
  - External API: Chillin render service

Added This Session:
  - @supabase/mcp-server-supabase: latest - Direct database management
  
Services:
  - Next.js dev: Port 3000 - Main application
  - Supabase: Cloud - Database and storage
  - Chillin API: Cloud - Video rendering service
```

## Test Commands
```bash
# Command 1: Test storage bucket access
curl -s https://leeslkgwtmgfewsbxwyu.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/list/videos
# Expected: {"statusCode":"404","error":"Bucket not found"} (until SQL script runs)

# Command 2: Test application startup
npm run dev
# Expected: Server running on http://localhost:3000

# Command 3: Test large file upload (after bucket creation)
# Upload 142.3MB video via dashboard
# Expected: No 413 errors, successful Supabase upload, URL-based rendering
```

## Next Session Setup
### Immediate Continue
```bash
# If continuing immediately, run:
cd "/Users/phildown/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/Video Editing Test/video-analysis-app"
npm run dev
# Current work is in: Storage bucket configuration
# Next step: Execute fix-storage-buckets.sql in Supabase dashboard
```

### TODOs with Context
1. **Execute Storage Bucket SQL Script**
   - Approach: Copy supabase/fix-storage-buckets.sql to Supabase SQL Editor
   - URL: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/leeslkgwtmgfewsbxwyu/sql/new
   - Gotchas: Must run as project owner, creates public buckets
   - Expected result: videos and public buckets created with 500MB limits

2. **Test Large File Rendering End-to-End**
   - Approach: Upload 142.3MB video and attempt render
   - Files to monitor: Browser console, server logs, network requests
   - Expected: No example.com redirect, successful render job submission
   - Validation: Check URL format and Chillin API response

3. **Restart Claude Code (Optional)**
   - Approach: Restart to load MCP Supabase integration
   - Once loaded: Direct database management via MCP commands
   - Benefit: No need for manual SQL script execution

4. **Implement File Cleanup Strategy**
   - Blocked by: Storage buckets need to be created first
   - Once unblocked: Add automatic deletion of old render files
   - Files to modify: lib/video-upload.ts (add cleanup functions)
