# Session Summary - January 12, 2025

## Quick Resume
```bash
# Commands to get back to exact working state
cd "/Users/phildown/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/Video Editing Test/video-analysis-app"
npm install  # If needed
npm run dev
# Verify working: http://localhost:3000
# Upload a video and click on segments to test preview functionality
```

## Session Context
**What was working before this session:**
- AI video analysis with Gemini 2.5 Pro
- Video upload and processing (up to 2GB)
- Segment detection and analysis
- Basic video preview with HTML5 controls
- Include/exclude toggles for segments
- Export to JSON/CSV with filtering
- Keyboard navigation
- Video orientation support (portrait/landscape/square)

**What initiated this session:**
User request: "Is it possible to only show the clip that has been cut out?" followed by refinement to show 5 seconds before and after with purple cut markers, then need for localized timeline control.

**Current state:**
✅ All previous features working
✅ Custom video player with localized timeline
✅ Preview window shows 5s before + segment + 5s after
✅ Custom controls replace default HTML5 controls
✅ Bounded scrubbing within preview window only

## Changes Made
| Location | What Changed | Why | How to Test |
|----------|--------------|-----|-------------|
| `app/page.tsx:1-35` | Added `parseTime()` utility function at component level | Avoid duplicate declarations | Parse any timestamp |
| `app/page.tsx:45-50` | Added video preview state variables | Track preview window boundaries | Check state in React DevTools |
| `app/page.tsx:884-894` | Removed HTML5 controls, added `ref={videoRef}` | Enable custom control | Video should have no default controls |
| `app/page.tsx:810-880` | Added custom timeline component (old timeline) | Visual reference for full segment | Shows cut markers in context |
| `app/page.tsx:978-1074` | Added localized preview timeline | Focus on preview window only | Scrub within ~15 second window |
| `app/page.tsx:894-942` | Updated `onLoadedMetadata` to calculate preview bounds | Set up preview window | Video seeks to 5s before cut |
| `app/page.tsx:943-952` | Added `onTimeUpdate` with boundary enforcement | Prevent seeking outside preview | Video auto-stops at preview end |
| `app/page.tsx:1075-1120` | Added custom playback controls | Replace default controls | Play/Pause/Restart buttons work |
| `app/page.tsx:228-239` | Added `handleTimelineClick()` function | Enable timeline scrubbing | Click/drag on timeline to seek |
| `app/page.tsx:171-194` | Added global mouse event listeners | Smooth dragging | Drag continues outside timeline |

## Problems & Solutions
### Issue: Duplicate `parseTime` Function Declarations
```
Error: Module parse failed: Identifier 'parseTime' has already been declared
```
**Tried:** Having parseTime defined in multiple places within component  
**Solution:** Moved `parseTime()` to component level as shared utility function  
**Key Learning:** In React components, utility functions should be defined once at component level

### Issue: Variable Name Conflicts
```
Error: Identifier 'segmentStart' has already been declared
ReferenceError: segmentStartTime is not defined
```
**Tried:** Using same variable names in different scopes  
**Solution:** Used unique variable names: `segStart/segEnd` in one scope, `segmentStartTime/segmentEndTime` in another  
**Key Learning:** Even in different closure scopes, Next.js compilation can conflict on variable names

### Issue: Video Scrubbing Entire Duration
**Problem:** Users had to scrub through 20+ minute videos to review 15-second segments  
**Solution:** Created custom timeline representing only preview window  
**Key Learning:** Custom video controls provide better UX than browser defaults for specific use cases

## Data/State Created
```yaml
Files:
  - Created: /app/TESTING_NOTES.md
  - Created: /LOCALIZED_PREVIEW_FEATURE.md
  - Created: /Session Summaries/2025-01-12_video-preview-localized-timeline.md
  - Modified: /app/page.tsx (extensive changes)

State Variables Added:
  - isDragging: boolean (timeline drag state)
  - previewStart: number (preview window start time in seconds)
  - previewEnd: number (preview window end time in seconds)  
  - previewDuration: number (total preview window duration)
  - videoRef: RefObject<HTMLVideoElement>
  - timelineRef: RefObject<HTMLDivElement>

Configuration:
  - Video preview: 5 seconds padding before/after cuts
  - Auto-loop: Returns to preview start when reaching end
  - Boundary enforcement: Prevents seeking outside preview window
```

## Technical Decisions
| Question | Choice | Alternative Considered | Reasoning |
|----------|--------|------------------------|-----------|
| How to show only segment? | 5s padding before/after | Show only exact segment | Context helps users make better decisions |
| Controls implementation | Hide HTML5, build custom | Overlay on HTML5 controls | Complete control over functionality |
| Timeline scope | Preview window only | Dual timeline (full + preview) | Simpler, focused interaction |
| Scrubbing method | Click and drag | Click only | More intuitive, familiar pattern |
| Boundary handling | Clamp and loop | Stop at boundaries | Better for repeated viewing |
| Time display | Relative to preview | Absolute video time | Easier to understand position |

## Project Patterns Discovered
```yaml
Naming:
  - Time variables: parseTime(), segmentStart, previewStart
  - Handler functions: handleSegmentClick, handleTimelineClick
  - State pairs: isPlaying/setIsPlaying, isDragging/setIsDragging

Structure:
  - Utility functions at component top level
  - Complex calculations in IIFE within JSX: {(() => { ... })()}
  - Refs for direct DOM manipulation: videoRef, timelineRef

Error Handling:
  - Boundary checks: Math.max(0, ...), Math.min(duration, ...)
  - Null checks: if (!videoRef.current) return
  - State guards: if (previewDuration === 0) return null

UI Patterns:
  - Color coding: Green (keep), Red (remove), Purple (markers), Blue (progress)
  - Visual feedback: Hover states, selected states, animations
  - Progressive disclosure: Video panel slides in from right
```

## User Preferences Observed
```yaml
Prefers:
  - Visual indicators: Purple markers for cuts, color coding
  - Contextual preview: 5s before/after rather than just the cut
  - Focused interfaces: Localized timeline over full video timeline
  - Planning mode: Likes to plan before implementation
  - Model switching: Comfortable switching between Opus/Sonnet for cost

Avoids:
  - Generic solutions: Wanted specific preview window, not full video
  - Default browser controls: Preferred custom implementation

Communication Style:
  - Direct questions: "Is it possible to..."
  - Clear requirements: Specific about 5-second padding and purple markers
  - Iterative refinement: Built on initial request with more specific needs
  - Cost-conscious: Asked about complexity for model selection
```

```

## Next Session Setup
### Immediate Continue
```bash
# If continuing immediately, run:
cd "/Users/phildown/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/Video Editing Test/video-analysis-app"
npm run dev
# Current work is in: app/page.tsx (video preview components)
# Next step: Could add waveform visualization or frame-by-frame controls
```

### TODOs with Context
1. **Add frame-by-frame navigation**
   - Approach: Add buttons for single frame forward/backward
   - Files to modify: `app/page.tsx`
   - Implementation: `video.currentTime += 1/30` (assuming 30fps)
   - Reference: Check video.playbackRate for frame rate

2. **Add waveform visualization**
   - Approach: Use Web Audio API to extract audio data
   - Files to modify: Create new component `components/Waveform.tsx`
   - Gotchas: Need to handle videos without audio
   - Blocked by: Need to research Web Audio API with video element

3. **Export preview clips**
   - Approach: Use FFmpeg.wasm to trim video client-side
   - Files to modify: New API route or client-side processing
   - Gotchas: FFmpeg.wasm is large (~30MB)
   - Reference: https://github.com/ffmpegwasm/ffmpeg.wasm

4. **Add keyboard shortcuts for timeline**
   - Approach: Add left/right arrow keys for frame stepping
   - Current: Only have segment navigation with arrows
   - Implementation: Check if video panel is focused, then control video

5. **Multi-segment preview**
   - Approach: Queue multiple segments to play in sequence
   - Use case: Preview all cuts in order before exporting
   - Challenge: Smooth transitions between segments
