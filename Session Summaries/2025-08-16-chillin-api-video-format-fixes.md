# Session Summary - August 16, 2025

## Quick Resume
```bash
# Commands to get back to exact working state
cd "/Users/phildown/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/Video Editing Test/video-analysis-app"
npm run dev  # Running on port 3000
# Verify working: http://localhost:3000/dashboard
# Note: Chillin account needs credits added
```

## Session Context
**What was working before this session:**
- Video upload to Gemini and Supabase
- Basic Chillin API integration (with 403 errors on Supabase URLs)
- Video analysis and segment detection
- Dashboard UI for reviewing segments

**What initiated this session:**
- Previous session summary review
- Need to fix 403 "Invalid signature" errors when Chillin tried to access Supabase videos
- Testing video rendering with different formats

**Current state:**
- ✅ MP4 files work perfectly with Chillin
- ❌ MOV files cause "Invalid duration NaN" errors in ffmpeg
- ✅ Timestamp parsing fixed for MM:SS:FF format
- ✅ Error handling improved
- ⚠️ Chillin account out of credits (code 2008)
- ✅ Supabase public URLs work with MP4 files

## Changes Made
| Location | What Changed | Why | How to Test |
|----------|--------------|-----|-------------|
| `lib/services/chillin.ts:110-149` | Rewrote parseTimeToSeconds function | Fixed timestamp interpretation (MM:SS:FF vs HH:MM:SS) | Upload 7-min video, check duration calculation |
| `app/api/render/chillin/route.ts:6` | Added `let body: any = {}` outside try block | Fixed "body is not defined" error in catch block | Trigger an error, check console |
| `app/api/render/chillin/route.ts:35-41` | Removed proxy/signed URL conversion | Neither approach worked with Chillin | Check render submission |
| `app/api/proxy/video/[...path]/route.ts` | Created proxy endpoint (unused) | Attempted workaround for 403 errors | Not currently used |

## Problems & Solutions

### Issue: 403 "Invalid signature" with Supabase URLs
```
Error: request returned unexpected status code 403: {"error":"Invalid signature"}
```
**Tried:** 
- Signed URLs with 2-hour expiration
- Proxy endpoint through localhost
- Various authentication approaches

**Solution:** Use MP4 format instead of MOV - the 403 was actually secondary to format issues

**Key Learning:** Chillin works fine with Supabase public URLs when using MP4 format

### Issue: MOV files cause NaN duration errors
```
Error: Invalid duration for option t: NaN
Error parsing options for output file /tmp/[id].aac
```
**Tried:**
- Different segment parameters
- Signed URLs
- Safe/conservative timestamps

**Solution:** Convert videos to MP4 format before uploading

**Key Learning:** Chillin's ffmpeg cannot properly read MOV file metadata

### Issue: Timestamp parsing errors (7min video seen as 4.6 hours)
```
Error: render credit not enough (tried to render 16701.8 seconds from 436.9 second video)
```
**Tried:**
- Various parsing logic for HH:MM:SS vs MM:SS:FF

**Solution:** Detect when third number > 60 or first < 60 to identify MM:SS:FF format

**Key Learning:** Gemini uses MM:SS:FF format where FF is centiseconds (00-99)

### Issue: Chillin account out of credits
```
Error: {"code": 2008, "msg": "render credit not enough"}
```
**Solution:** Need to add credits at https://chillin.online/render-console

**Key Learning:** Check credit balance before large renders

## Data/State Created
```yaml
Database:
  - No database changes
  
Files:

  - Created: test-signed-url.js
  - Created: test-signed-safe.js
  - Created: test-pexels-video.js
  - Created: test-pexels-longer.js
  - Created: test-dropbox-video.js
  - Modified: lib/services/chillin.ts
  - Modified: app/api/render/chillin/route.ts
  
Configuration:
  - Environment: All keys remain the same
  
External Services:
  - Chillin API: Render IDs 106079-106088 created
  - Supabase: Multiple test videos uploaded
  - Test video URLs:
    - Pexels (works): https://videos.pexels.com/video-files/1526909/1526909-hd_1280_720_24fps.mp4
    - Dropbox (failed): MOV with redirects
```

## Technical Decisions
| Question | Choice | Alternative Considered | Reasoning |
|----------|--------|------------------------|-----------|
| How to fix 403 errors? | Use MP4 format | Signed URLs, Proxy endpoint | MP4s work directly, MOV has metadata issues |
| Timestamp format? | Detect MM:SS:FF when FF>60 | Always assume HH:MM:SS | Gemini uses centiseconds for frame timing |
| Error handling? | Declare body outside try | Leave as-is | Needed body reference in catch block |
| Video hosting? | Keep Supabase | Switch to S3/Cloudinary | Supabase works fine with MP4 |

## Project Patterns Discovered
```yaml
Naming:
  - Test files: test-[feature].js
  - API routes: /api/[service]/[action]/route.ts
  - Timestamp format: MM:SS:FF for videos under 1 hour
  
Structure:
  - Services in lib/services/
  - Types in lib/types/
  - Components use 'use client' directive
  
Error Handling:
  - Return {error: string, details?: string} from APIs
  - Console.error for errors, console.log for debugging
  - Try-catch with specific error messages
  
Testing:
  - Node.js scripts for API testing
  - Direct curl commands for verification
```

## User Preferences Observed
```yaml
Prefers:
  - Testing with real files immediately
  - Understanding root causes before implementing fixes
  - Keeping existing infrastructure (Supabase)
  
Avoids:
  - Switching services unnecessarily
  - Temporary workarounds
  
Communication Style:
  - Direct and concise
  - Provides screenshots for errors
  - Tests incrementally (small file, then large)
```

## Environment & Dependencies
```yaml
Stack:
  - Language: TypeScript/JavaScript (Node.js)
  - Framework: Next.js 14 (App Router)
  - Database: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Storage)
  - Video Processing: Gemini API + Chillin API
  - Key Libraries:
    - @supabase/supabase-js
    - react 18
    - tailwindcss

Added This Session:
  - No new dependencies

Services:
  - Next.js Dev: Port 3000 - Main application
  - Supabase: Cloud - Database and storage
  - Gemini API: Cloud - Video analysis
  - Chillin API: Cloud - Video rendering (needs credits)
```

## Test Commands
```bash
# Test 1: Check if MP4 upload works
# Upload any MP4 file through dashboard
# Expected: Successful analysis and render submission

# Test 2: Verify timestamp parsing
node -e "
function parse(t) {
  const [a,b,c] = t.split(':').map(Number);
  return a*60 + b + c/100;
}
console.log('01:04:41 =', parse('01:04:41'), 'seconds');
"
# Expected: 01:04:41 = 64.41 seconds

# Test 3: Check Chillin render status
curl -X POST https://render-api.chillin.online/render/result \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $CHILLIN_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"render_id": 106087}' | jq
# Expected: State and video_url if successful
```

## Next Session Setup
### Immediate Continue
```bash
# If continuing immediately, run:
cd "/Users/phildown/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/Video Editing Test/video-analysis-app"
npm run dev
# Current work is complete - system functional with MP4 files
# Next step: Add Chillin credits and test large MP4 renders
```

### TODOs with Context
1. **Add MOV to MP4 conversion**
   - Approach: Use ffmpeg.wasm in browser or server-side ffmpeg
   - Files to modify: components/video-uploader.tsx or new API route
   - Gotchas: Large files might timeout, need streaming approach
   - Reference: https://github.com/ffmpegwasm/ffmpeg.wasm

2. **Add Chillin credit balance check**
   - Approach: Call Chillin API to check balance before render
   - Files to modify: lib/services/chillin.ts
   - Gotchas: API endpoint not documented, might need support
   - Reference: Contact support@chillin.online

3. **Improve timestamp format detection**
   - Blocked by: Need more video samples to test
   - Once unblocked: Add video duration context to parseTimeToSeconds

4. **Add video format validation**
   - Approach: Check file extension and show warning for MOV
   - Files to modify: components/video-uploader.tsx
   - Gotchas: Some MOV files might work, depends on codec
