# Session Summary - August 14, 2025 (Evening Session)

## Quick Resume
```bash
# Commands to get back to exact working state
cd "/Users/phildown/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/Video Editing Test/video-analysis-app"
npm run dev
# Server running at: http://localhost:3000
# GitHub repo: https://github.com/phillipshepard1/video-editing-tool.git
```

## Session Context
**What was working before this session:**
- Core Gemini video analysis with segment detection
- Video preview with timeline scrubbing
- Smart filtering system with categories
- Export to EDL, FCPXML, Premiere XML formats
- Upload progress and MOV file handling (from earlier session)

**What initiated this session:**
User request: "remind yourself about the cluster thing we are working on" followed by need to implement clustering for repeated takes

**Current state:**
- ✅ Clustering workflow fully implemented and deployed
- ✅ 3-step workflow: Clusters → Filters → Export
- ✅ Intelligent overlap detection prevents double-cutting
- ✅ UI redesigned to match clean terminal style
- ✅ All changes pushed to GitHub

## Changes Made
| Location | What Changed | Why | How to Test |
|----------|--------------|-----|-------------|
| `lib/clustering.ts` | Created clustering detection algorithm | Identify repeated takes automatically | Upload video with multiple takes |
| `components/WorkflowManagerV2.tsx` | New 3-step workflow manager | Organize editing process logically | Click through steps 1-3 |
| `components/ClusterPanel.tsx` | Step 1 cluster handling UI | Select best takes from groups | Review detected clusters |
| `components/EnhancedFilterPanel.tsx` | Step 2 with "Already Cut" section | Show what clusters handled | Check hidden segments list |
| `components/FinalReviewPanel.tsx` | Step 3 export and review | Final verification before export | Review stats and export |
| `app/page.tsx:473-494` | Removed toggle, use workflow only | Simplify UX, clustering is primary | Load any analysis |

## Problems & Solutions

### Issue: FilterPanel Props Mismatch
```
Error: TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'bad_take')
```
**Tried:** Passing wrong props to FilterPanel in WorkflowManager  
**Solution:** Created EnhancedFilterPanel wrapper with correct props and initialized filterState properly  
**Key Learning:** Component prop interfaces must match exactly; create wrappers when needed

### Issue: JSX Syntax Errors After Edit
```
Error: Expected '</', got 'div'
```
**Tried:** Manual editing of JSX structure  
**Solution:** Carefully matched opening/closing tags, removed old UI code completely  
**Key Learning:** When removing conditional rendering, ensure all brackets/tags are balanced

### Issue: Segment Overlap Logic
```
Problem: Segments within cluster removals still showing in filter view
```
**Tried:** Simple filtering based on time ranges  
**Solution:** Implemented findOverlappingSegments() with hierarchy rules  
**Key Learning:** Longer segments override shorter ones; maintain transparency with "Already Cut" section

```yaml
Files:
  - Created: lib/clustering.ts (288 lines)
  - Created: components/WorkflowManagerV2.tsx (241 lines)

Git:
  - Committed: "Add intelligent clustering workflow for repeated takes"
  - Pushed to: https://github.com/phillipshepard1/video-editing-tool.git

  - ClusterSelection[] tracks user choices per cluster
  - hiddenSegments[] maintains overlap transparency
  - filterState controls Step 2 visibility
```

## Technical Decisions
| Question | Choice | Alternative Considered | Reasoning |
|----------|--------|------------------------|-----------|
| Workflow steps | 3-step linear process | All-in-one view | Reduces cognitive load, clear progression |
| Cluster detection | Text similarity + temporal proximity | AI-only detection | Hybrid approach more reliable |
| Overlap handling | Hide with transparency | Remove from data | Users need to know what's hidden |
| UI framework | Keep existing components | Complete redesign | Faster implementation, consistency |
| Default winner | Gap after failed attempts | Last attempt | Clean delivery usually follows failures |

## Project Patterns Discovered
```yaml
Naming:
  - Components: PascalCase with descriptive names
  - Types: TakeCluster, ClusterSelection (domain-specific)
  - Functions: verb-first (detectClusters, findOverlappingSegments)
  
Structure:
  - Business logic in lib/ folder
  - Components grouped by feature
  - Props interfaces defined inline
  
Error Handling:
  - Try-catch in parsing functions
  - Null checks for video refs
  - Default states prevent undefined errors
  
Testing:
  - Manual testing with real video files
  - Console logging for debugging
  - UI mockups before implementation
```

## User Preferences Observed
```yaml
Communication Style:
  - Direct requests: "ok remind yourself about the cluster thing"
  - Visual feedback important: "can you mock this up in a quick browser"
  - Iterative refinement: "this logic is correct -- can we start building"
  
Development Approach:
  - Plans before implementation
  - UI mockups for validation
  - Clean, professional styling preferred
  - Terminal/monospace aesthetic
  
Feature Priorities:
  1. Handling repeated takes efficiently
  2. Transparency about edits
  3. Clean, intuitive workflow
  4. Professional appearance
```

## Environment & Dependencies
```yaml
Stack:
  - Framework: Next.js 15.4.6
  - Runtime: Node v22.18.0
  - UI: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
  - Video Analysis: Gemini 2.5 Pro API
  - TypeScript: Strict mode enabled

Added This Session:
  - No new dependencies (used existing infrastructure)

Services:
  - Dev Server: Port 3000 - Next.js development
  - API Routes: /api/analysis/* - Gemini integration
  
Known Issues:
  - MOV codec support varies by browser
  - Upload progress is simulated (Next.js limitation)
  - Large files (>2GB) exceed Gemini limits
```

## Test Commands
```bash
# Test 1: Verify clustering detection
# Upload "Test Video For Talking Head.mov"
# Expected: Multiple clusters detected in Step 1

# Test 2: Check overlap prevention
# Select cluster winners in Step 1
# Go to Step 2
# Expected: "Already Cut" section shows hidden segments

# Test 3: Export functionality
# Complete all steps
# Click Export FCPXML
# Expected: Download with cluster edits applied

# Test 4: Git status
git log --oneline -3
# Expected: Shows clustering workflow commit
```

## Next Session Setup
### Immediate Continue
```bash
# If continuing immediately, run:
cd "/Users/phildown/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/Video Editing Test/video-analysis-app"
npm run dev
# Current focus: Test with various video types
# Monitor for edge cases in clustering detection
```

### TODOs with Context
1. **Enhance Cluster Detection Algorithm**
   - Approach: Add audio waveform similarity
   - Files to modify: lib/clustering.ts
   - Gotchas: Need audio processing capability
   - Reference: Could use Web Audio API

2. **Add Cluster Preview Comparison**
   - Approach: Side-by-side video preview
   - Files to modify: components/ClusterPanel.tsx
   - Gotchas: Multiple video elements performance
   - Reference: Use canvas for sync playback

3. **Persistence of Cluster Selections**
   - Approach: Save to localStorage or session
   - Files to modify: components/WorkflowManagerV2.tsx
   - Gotchas: Clear on new analysis
   - Reference: Use analysis ID as key

4. **Cluster Confidence Scoring**
   - Approach: ML-based similarity scoring
   - Blocked by: Need training data
   - Once unblocked: Integrate with detection

5. **Export Cluster Metadata**
   - Approach: Add cluster info to export formats
   - Files to modify: lib/export-formats.ts
   - Gotchas: Format compatibility
   - Reference: Use comment fields in EDL

## Raw Reference Data
```
# Cluster Detection Patterns
- False starts: "restart", "try again", "let me"
- Temporal proximity: <15 seconds between attempts
- Winner identification: Gap after last failed attempt
- Confidence calculation: Average + consistency bonus
