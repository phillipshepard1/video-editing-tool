# Session Summary - 2025-08-25

## Quick Resume
```bash
# Commands to get back to exact working state
cd "/Users/phildown/Desktop/Video Editing Project/video-editing-tool"
npm run dev  # Development server runs on http://localhost:3000
# Verify working: http://localhost:3000/dashboard
```

## Session Context
**What was working before this session:**
- Basic video thumbnails in Recent Projects and Processing Queue
- Video analysis with Gemini API
- Content clustering for multiple takes
- Basic segment detection and removal

**What initiated this session:**
User reported that Gemini prompt was not detecting silent parts properly - segments were starting with 5-6 seconds of silence before speech began. The clustering was picking correct content but boundaries were too early.

**Current state:**
- Enhanced silence detection in Gemini prompts
- Segment boundary refinement working
- Visual indicators for trimmed silence
- Audio analysis utilities created
- System now trims silence automatically

## Changes Made
| Location | What Changed | Why | How to Test |
|----------|--------------|-----|-------------|
| `lib/services/gemini.ts:198-307` | Enhanced Gemini prompt with silence detection instructions | Need precise speech boundaries, not just segment boundaries | Upload a video with silence at beginning |
| `lib/audio-analysis.ts` | Created audio level detection utilities | Client-side silence detection capability | Import and use in video components |
| `lib/segment-refinement.ts` | Added post-processing for segment boundaries | Refine boundaries after Gemini analysis | Check refined segments have `wasRefined: true` |
| `app/api/analysis/process-enhanced/route.ts:36-58` | Applied automatic refinement to API | Process all analyses with silence trimming | Check API response includes `refinementApplied: true` |
| `components/ContentGroupsPanel.tsx:56-92` | Use refined boundaries for playback | Play from actual speech start | Click play on a take, should skip silence |
| `components/ContentGroupCard.tsx:268-295` | Added visual indicators for trimmed silence | Show users what was trimmed | Look for purple scissors icon and timing info |
| `app/dashboard/page.tsx:42-134` | Added thumbnail support to Recent Projects | Visual preview and clickable cards | Check Recent Projects section shows video thumbnails |
| `components/job-list.tsx:155-177` | Added video thumbnails to Processing Queue | Consistent visual experience | Processing Queue shows inline video previews |

## Problems & Solutions
### Issue: Gemini Not Detecting Silence
```
Error: Segments starting with 5-6 seconds of dead air before speech
```
**Tried:** Initial basic prompts just asked for pause detection  
**Solution:** Added explicit instructions for:
- Detecting silence at start/end of each segment
- Providing both segment boundaries AND speech boundaries  
- Measuring silence duration in seconds
- Fields: `speechStart`, `speechEnd`, `leadingSilence`, `trailingSilence`  
**Key Learning:** LLMs need very explicit instructions about what constitutes "silence" and how to measure it

### Issue: Variable Name Collision
```
Error: Identifier 'refinedTake' has already been declared
```
**Tried:** Using same variable name in multiple places  
**Solution:** Renamed conflicting variables to unique names (`segmentStartTime`, `segmentEndTime`)  
**Key Learning:** TypeScript is strict about variable scoping in closures

## Data/State Created
```yaml
Files:
  - Created: lib/audio-analysis.ts
  - Created: lib/segment-refinement.ts
  - Modified: lib/services/gemini.ts
  - Modified: app/api/analysis/process-enhanced/route.ts
  - Modified: components/ContentGroupsPanel.tsx
  - Modified: components/ContentGroupCard.tsx
  - Modified: app/dashboard/page.tsx
  - Modified: components/job-list.tsx
  - Modified: components/queue-video-uploader.tsx
  - Modified: app/api/upload/queue-fast/route.ts
  
Configuration:
  - Silence threshold: -40dB (default)
  - Minimum silence to trim: 0.5 seconds
  - Transition buffer: 0.15 seconds (optional)
```

## Technical Decisions
| Question | Choice | Alternative Considered | Reasoning |
|----------|--------|------------------------|-----------|
| Where to detect silence? | Gemini API + post-processing | Pure client-side analysis | Gemini has full video context, client refines |
| Silence threshold | -40dB default | Fixed time-based | Audio level more accurate than duration alone |
| When to apply refinement? | Automatically in API | User-triggered | Better UX with automatic improvement |
| Visual indicator style | Purple scissors icon + time | Just highlight color | Clear what was changed and by how much |

## Project Patterns Discovered
```yaml
Naming:
  - Types: lib/types/[domain].ts (e.g., takes.ts, segments.ts)
  - Services: lib/services/[service].ts
  - Components: components/[ComponentName].tsx
  
Structure:
  - API routes: app/api/[resource]/[action]/route.ts
  - Utilities: lib/[utility-name].ts
  - Time format: "MM:SS" strings throughout
  
Error Handling:
  - API returns: { success: boolean, error?: string, data?: any }
  - Console.warn for non-critical issues
  - Console.error for failures
  
Testing:
  - Manual testing via dashboard
  - Console.log for debugging
  - No automated tests observed
```

## User Preferences Observed
```yaml
Prefers:
  - Visual feedback for all operations
  - Automatic improvements without asking
  - Clear indicators of what changed
  - Hover interactions for video previews
  
Communication Style:
  - Direct and specific about problems
  - Provides screenshots to illustrate issues
  - Wants "ultrathinking" for complex problems
  - Appreciates comprehensive solutions
```

```

## Next Session Setup
### Immediate Continue
```bash
# If continuing immediately, run:
cd "/Users/phildown/Desktop/Video Editing Project/video-editing-tool"
npm run dev
# Current work is in: Silence detection and boundary refinement
# Next step: Test with real videos containing silence
```

### TODOs with Context
1. **Add client-side audio waveform visualization**
   - Approach: Use Web Audio API to show audio levels
   - Files to modify: Create `components/AudioWaveform.tsx`
   - Gotchas: Need to handle CORS for video URLs
   - Reference: `lib/audio-analysis.ts` has audio context setup

2. **Add manual boundary adjustment UI**
   - Approach: Draggable handles on timeline
   - Files to modify: `components/ContentGroupCard.tsx`
   - Once implemented: Users can fine-tune boundaries

3. **Optimize Gemini prompt tokens**
   - Current prompt is lengthy
   - Could reduce by removing redundant instructions
   - Monitor token usage in responses

4. **Add silence detection settings**
   - Let users configure threshold
   - Add to user preferences/settings
   - Default to -40dB but make adjustable

---
*Key for next session: Look at "Quick Resume" first, then check if silence detection is working properly with real videos. The main enhancement is that segments now start when speech actually begins, not at arbitrary boundaries.*
