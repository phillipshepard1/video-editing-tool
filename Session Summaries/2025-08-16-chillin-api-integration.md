# Session Summary - August 16, 2025

## Quick Resume
```bash
# Commands to get back to exact working state
cd "/Users/phildown/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/Video Editing Test/video-analysis-app"
npm run dev  # Running on port 3000
# Verify working: http://localhost:3000/dashboard
# Test render: node test-render-only.js
```

## Session Context
**What was working before this session:**
- Video upload to Gemini for analysis
- Segment detection and categorization
- UI for reviewing and editing segments
- Export to EDL/FCPXML formats

**What initiated this session:**
- Persistent "Bucket not found" error when uploading to Supabase (2nd occurrence)
- Need to integrate Chillin video rendering API
- User wanted permanent solution, not temporary fix

**Current state:**
- ✅ Supabase upload working (using service key on server-side)
- ✅ Chillin API integration functional with correct field names
- ✅ Parallel upload to Gemini + Supabase implemented
- ⚠️ Local API endpoint `/api/render/chillin` sometimes hangs (but direct Chillin API works)
- ✅ Documentation created for Chillin API

## Changes Made
| Location | What Changed | Why | How to Test |
|----------|--------------|-----|-------------|
| `/api/storage/upload/route.ts` | Created server-side upload with service key | Client-side anon key couldn't access bucket due to RLS | Upload a video through UI |
| `lib/services/chillin.ts` | Changed `sourceIn/sourceOut` to `startInSource` + duration | Wrong field names per Chillin docs | `node test-render-only.js` |
| `lib/services/chillin.ts` | Added all required Video element fields | Missing required fields like `hasAudio`, `volume` | Check render submission |
| `lib/services/chillin.ts` | Changed status endpoint from GET `/status/{id}` to POST `/render/result` | Wrong endpoint per API docs | Test status polling |
| `/api/analysis/upload/route.ts` | Added parallel upload to Supabase | Optimize render time by pre-uploading | Check upload logs |
| `components/FinalReviewPanel.tsx` | Added pre-uploaded URL support | Skip upload step when rendering | Check render without upload delay |
| `projectData.type` | Changed from empty string to 'video' | Invalid value per API docs | Check request payload |
| `docs/CHILLIN_API_REFERENCE.md` | Created comprehensive API documentation | Reference for debugging | N/A |

## Problems & Solutions

### Issue: Bucket Not Found (Supabase)
```
Error: Failed to upload to any available bucket
StorageApiError: Bucket not found
```
**Tried:** 
- Using client-side Supabase with anon key
- Creating bucket through UI
- Checking bucket permissions

**Solution:** Server-side upload using service key in `/api/storage/upload`
```typescript
const supabaseAdmin = createClient(
  process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!,
  process.env.SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY!,
  {auth: {persistSession: false}}
);
```

**Key Learning:** Row Level Security (RLS) can block anon key access even if bucket exists. Service key bypasses RLS.

### Issue: Chillin API Format Errors
```
Error: missing required field: view/width/height
Error: invalid project data
```
**Tried:**
- Using `sourceIn` and `sourceOut` fields
- Various JSON structures
- Different field combinations

**Solution:** 
1. Use `startInSource` (not `sourceIn`)
2. Include all required fields: `hasAudio`, `volume`, `width`, `height`
3. Use `compositeWidth/Height` at root, `width/height` in projectData
4. Set `projectData.type` to 'video' (not empty string)

**Key Learning:** Chillin uses `startInSource` + `duration` to define segments, not start/end points.

### Issue: Render Status Hanging
```
Error: Request timeout after multiple attempts
```
**Tried:**
- GET request to `/render/v1/status/{id}`
- Increasing timeout values
- Different polling intervals

**Solution:** 
- Use POST to `/render/result` with body: `{"render_id": 12345}`
- Added 10-second timeout to prevent hanging
- Return "processing" status on timeout instead of error

**Key Learning:** Chillin's status endpoint is `/render/result` (POST), not `/status/{id}` (GET).

### Issue: GPU Instance Destroyed
```
Error: GPU instance 25012968 was destroyed during rendering
```
**Tried:** N/A - Infrastructure issue

**Solution:** User clarified they killed the operation

**Key Learning:** Large videos (42+ minutes) take significant time in Chillin's queue.

## Data/State Created
```yaml
Database:
  - Supabase Storage: 'videos' bucket with 5GB limit
  - Example video URLs: 
    - https://leeslkgwtmgfewsbxwyu.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/videos/renders/video_1755317871149.mp4
    - https://leeslkgwtmgfewsbxwyu.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/videos/uploads/video_[timestamp].mp4
  
Files:
  - Created: /api/storage/upload/route.ts
  - Created: docs/CHILLIN_API_REFERENCE.md
  - Created: test-render-only.js
  - Created: test-full-flow.js
  - Modified: lib/services/chillin.ts
  - Modified: components/FinalReviewPanel.tsx
  - Modified: /api/analysis/upload/route.ts
  
Configuration:
  - Environment: SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY (required)
  - Environment: CHILLIN_API_KEY (required)
  - Environment: NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
  - Environment: GEMINI_API_KEY
  
External Services:
  - Chillin API: https://render-api.chillin.online
  - Supabase: leeslkgwtmgfewsbxwyu.supabase.co
  - Test Render IDs: 106075, 106076, 106077
```

## Technical Decisions
| Question | Choice | Alternative Considered | Reasoning |
|----------|--------|------------------------|-----------|
| When to upload to Supabase? | During initial upload (parallel with Gemini) | Only when rendering | Saves time at render, frees memory, provides backup |
| How to handle RLS issues? | Server-side with service key | Disable RLS, modify policies | More secure, maintains RLS for other operations |
| Chillin timeout handling? | Return "processing" status | Throw error | Better UX, render might still be working |
| Video trimming approach? | startInSource + duration | sourceIn + sourceOut | Matches Chillin API documentation |
| API documentation location? | Markdown file in docs/ | Code comments only | Easier reference, shareable |

## Project Patterns Discovered
```yaml
Naming:
  - API routes: /api/[service]/[action]/route.ts
  - Components: PascalCase with descriptive names
  - Supabase files: [type]/video_[timestamp].[ext]
  
Structure:
  - Server-side operations in /api/ routes
  - Client components marked with 'use client'
  - Service logic in lib/services/
  - Types in lib/types/
  
Error Handling:
  - Return {error: string, details?: string} from APIs
  - Console.log for debugging, console.error for errors
  - Try-catch with specific error messages
  
Testing:
  - Direct API tests with curl
  - Node.js test scripts for integration
  - Console logging for debugging
```

## User Preferences Observed
```yaml
Prefers:
  - Permanent solutions over temporary fixes ("i need you to ultrathink on this one")
  - Direct testing ("can you test all this?")
  - Comprehensive documentation
  - Understanding root causes
  
Avoids:
  - Temporary workarounds
  - Incomplete solutions
  - Cleanup features before core functionality
  
Communication Style:
  - Direct and concise
  - Provides helpful context (API docs, screenshots)
  - Clear about priorities (fix first, cleanup later)
```

## Environment & Dependencies

## Test Commands
```bash
# Test 1: Direct Chillin API render
node test-render-only.js
# Expected: Render ID returned, status "pending" or "processing"

# Test 2: Check render status
curl -X POST https://render-api.chillin.online/render/result \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $(grep CHILLIN_API_KEY .env.local | cut -d= -f2)" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"render_id": 106077}' | python3 -m json.tool
# Expected: JSON with state field

# Test 3: Verify Supabase URL accessible
curl -I "https://leeslkgwtmgfewsbxwyu.supabase.co/storage/v1/object/public/videos/renders/video_1755317871149.mp4"
# Expected: HTTP 200 OK

# Test 4: Check parallel upload logs
# Upload a video and check console for:
# "Starting parallel uploads to Gemini and Supabase..."
```

## Next Session Setup
### Immediate Continue
```bash
# If continuing immediately, run:
cd "/Users/phildown/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/Video Editing Test/video-analysis-app"
npm run dev
# Current work is complete, system is functional
# Consider: Adding cleanup job for orphaned Supabase videos
```

### TODOs with Context
1. **Fix local API endpoint hanging issue**
   - Approach: Check middleware or request processing
   - Files to modify: `/api/render/chillin/route.ts`
   - Gotchas: Works with direct Chillin API, issue is local
   - Reference: Timeout occurs around request parsing

2. **Add cleanup for orphaned videos**
   - Approach: Cron job or scheduled function
   - Files to create: `/api/cleanup/route.ts`
   - Gotchas: Don't delete videos with active renders
   - Reference: Videos older than 24h with no render record

3. **Add video preview in review panel**
   - Approach: Use pre-uploaded Supabase URL
   - Files to modify: `components/FinalReviewPanel.tsx`
   - Gotchas: CORS settings on Supabase
   - Reference: URL available in `supabaseUrl` prop

4. **Optimize for very large videos**
   - Blocked by: Need to understand Chillin queue limits
   - Once unblocked: Consider chunking or compression
