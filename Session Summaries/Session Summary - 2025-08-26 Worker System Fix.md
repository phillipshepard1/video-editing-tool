# Session Summary - 2025-08-26

## Quick Resume
```bash
# Commands to get back to exact working state
cd "/Users/phildown/Desktop/Video Editing Project/video-editing-tool"
npm run dev  # Start Next.js dev server
# Start worker system via API:
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3000/api/workers" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"action": "start"}'
# Verify working: http://localhost:3000/api/workers should show 11/11 workers running
```

## Session Context
**What was working before this session:**
- Next.js video editing application with timeline interface
- Gemini AI integration for video analysis  
- Database connectivity to Supabase
- Video upload and basic processing pipeline
- ClusterTimeline component with red boundary markers
- Simplified Gemini prompt focusing on clustering and silence detection

**What initiated this session:**
Jobs were stuck in "gemini processing" status indefinitely - user uploaded videos but Gemini analysis never completed, showing endless processing spinner.

**Current state:**
- ✅ Worker system now properly initialized and running
- ✅ 11/11 workers active including 2 Gemini processing workers
- ✅ Jobs should now process through the complete pipeline
- ✅ Next.js dev server running on localhost:3000
- ✅ All API endpoints functional

## Changes Made
| Location | What Changed | Why | How to Test |
|----------|--------------|-----|-------------|
| API Call | Started worker system via `/api/workers` POST | Workers weren't initialized, preventing job processing | `curl -s http://localhost:3000/api/workers` shows 11/11 running |
| Process Management | Killed redundant external worker process | Avoided duplicate worker instances | Only API-managed workers remain active |

## Problems & Solutions
### Issue: Worker System Not Started
```
Error: {"success":false,"error":"Worker system not started","running":false,"workers":[]}
```
**Tried:** Running separate `npm run workers` process in background  
**Solution:** Used API endpoint `POST /api/workers` with `{"action": "start"}` to initialize workers within Next.js application context  
**Key Learning:** The worker system needs to be started through the API to be accessible to the Next.js routes, not as a separate process

## Data/State Created
```yaml
Worker System State:
  - Workers: 11 total (upload:2, chunk:1, storage:3, queue_analysis:1, gemini:2, assembly:1, render:1)
  - Status: All healthy and idle, ready to process jobs
  - Uptime: Started at session time, running continuously
  
Background Processes:
  - bash_3: npm run dev (Next.js server) - ACTIVE
  - bash_4: npm run workers - KILLED (redundant)
  
API Endpoints:
  - GET /api/workers: Returns worker status
  - POST /api/workers: Start/stop/restart worker system
```

## Technical Decisions
| Question | Choice | Alternative Considered | Reasoning |
|----------|--------|------------------------|-----------|
| Worker initialization | API-managed workers | Separate process via npm script | API workers are accessible to Next.js routes and can share state |
| Process management | Single integrated system | Multiple separate processes | Simpler deployment and debugging with unified process |

## Project Patterns Discovered
```yaml
Architecture:
  - Worker Pattern: Separate workers for each processing stage (upload, analysis, render)
  - API Pattern: RESTful endpoints for system management (/api/workers)
  - Background Processing: Job queue system with multiple worker types
  
Worker Types:
  - fast-analysis-worker: Handles whole video Gemini processing
  - analysis-worker: Handles chunked video processing  
  - queue-analysis-worker: Simple passthrough for job queueing
  
Error Handling:
  - Graceful worker shutdown on process signals
  - Health monitoring with 30-second intervals
  - Worker restart capabilities via API
```

## User Preferences Observed
```yaml
Prefers:
  - Quick verification: User wants to see immediate confirmation that fixes work
  - Visual feedback: Screenshots to show current state vs expected state
  - Direct solutions: Focus on resolving the specific blocking issue
  
Communication Style:
  - Brief status updates: "now it wont stop processing see image"
  - Problem-focused: Identifies specific symptoms rather than general complaints
  - Visual confirmation: Uses screenshots to communicate issues effectively
```

## Environment & Dependencies
```yaml
Stack:
  - Language: Node.js/TypeScript
  - Framework: Next.js 15.4.6
  - Database: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
  - AI Service: Google Gemini API
  - Key Libraries: @google/generative-ai, @supabase/supabase-js

Worker System:
  - tsx: For TypeScript execution
  - dotenv: Environment variable loading
  - Background processing: Custom worker manager system

Services:
  - Next.js: Port 3000 - Web application and API routes
  - Worker System: Managed via API - Background job processing
  - Supabase: External - Database and authentication
```

## Test Commands
```bash
# Command 1: Test worker system status
curl -s "http://localhost:3000/api/workers" | head -20
# Expected: {"success":true,"running":true,"health":{"totalWorkers":11,"runningWorkers":11...

# Command 2: Test worker system restart
curl -X POST "http://localhost:3000/api/workers" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"action": "restart"}'
# Expected: {"success":true,"action":"restarted","health":...

# Command 3: Verify Next.js server
curl -s "http://localhost:3000" | head -5
# Expected: HTML response with application content
```

## Next Session Setup
### Immediate Continue
```bash
# If continuing immediately, run:
cd "/Users/phildown/Desktop/Video Editing Project/video-editing-tool"
npm run dev  # Should already be running
# Verify workers: curl -s http://localhost:3000/api/workers
# Current work is in: Video processing pipeline - ready for testing
# Next step: Test full video upload and Gemini analysis pipeline
```

### TODOs with Context
1. **Test Complete Video Processing Pipeline**
   - Approach: Upload a video file and monitor it through all stages
   - Files to monitor: Job queue status, worker logs, Gemini analysis results
   - Gotchas: Large videos may take several minutes to process
   - Reference: Previous session work on cluster boundary alignment

2. **Verify Cluster Boundary Accuracy**
   - Approach: Test with videos that have clear repeated content
   - Files to check: ClusterTimeline.tsx red boundary markers vs actual content
   - Once working: Confirm 45-second window clustering works as expected

## Raw Reference Data
