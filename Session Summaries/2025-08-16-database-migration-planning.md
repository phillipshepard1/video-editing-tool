# Session Summary - August 16, 2025

## Quick Resume
```bash
# Commands to get back to exact working state
cd "/Users/phildown/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/Video Editing Test/video-analysis-app"
npm run dev  # Running on port 3000 (currently in background bash_1)
# Verify working: http://localhost:3000/dashboard
# Note: Session management table created, but large uploads still timeout
```

## Session Context
**What was working before this session:**
- Video analysis with Gemini API
- Segment detection and editing
- Chillin render API (with cost estimation fixes)
- Session management system (auto-save after analysis)

**What initiated this session:**
- 1.4GB video upload failed with timeout after 10+ minutes
- Supabase can't handle files over 1GB reliably
- Need for better database/storage solution with MCP support

**Current state:**
- ✅ Session management system implemented and working
- ✅ Timing calculations fixed ($0.10/min pricing accurate)
- ❌ Large file uploads (1GB+) still timeout on Supabase
- ✅ Research completed for alternatives (Neon + R2 recommended)

## Changes Made
| Location | What Changed | Why | How to Test |
|----------|--------------|-----|-------------|
| `lib/services/chillin.ts:231-243` | Added cost estimation logging | Show transparent pricing before render | Upload video, check console for cost |
| `lib/services/chillin.ts:47,218` | Added `isFrontTrimmed` field | Chillin API requires it when startInSource > 0 | Test render with trimmed segments |
| `components/SessionManager.tsx` | Created session management UI | Allow save/load without re-analysis | Click "Load Saved Sessions" |
| `app/api/sessions/*` | Created save/list/load endpoints | Backend for session management | Upload video, check auto-save |
| `supabase/create-sessions-table.sql` | Created analysis_sessions table | Store session data | Query table in Supabase dashboard |
| `lib/supabase-upload-chunked.ts` | Added chunked upload logic (unused) | Attempt to fix large file uploads | Not integrated yet |
| `docs/DATABASE_REQUIREMENTS.md` | Documented migration requirements | Define what we need from new DB | Reference for migration |

## Problems & Solutions

### Issue: Large File Upload Timeout
```
Error: Headers Timeout Error
code: 'UND_ERR_HEADERS_TIMEOUT'
POST /api/storage/upload 500 in 615709ms (10+ minutes)
```
**Tried:** 
- Adding `duplex: 'half'` to upload options
- Increasing timeouts to 5 minutes
- Creating chunked upload logic

**Solution:** Need to migrate to different storage (Cloudflare R2)  
**Key Learning:** Supabase storage isn't suitable for 1GB+ video files, need S3-compatible multipart uploads

### Issue: Chillin API Validation Error
```
Error: invalid project data: when startInSource > 0, isFrontTrimmed field is required and should be true
```
**Tried:** Various field combinations  
**Solution:** Added `isFrontTrimmed: segment.start > 0` to video elements  
**Key Learning:** Chillin API has undocumented required fields

### Issue: Session Table Missing Initially
```
Error: Could not find the table 'public.analysis_sessions' in the schema cache
```
**Tried:** Complex SQL with comments and RLS policies  
**Solution:** Simplified SQL without comments, created table manually  
**Key Learning:** Supabase SQL editor doesn't handle comments well

## Data/State Created
```yaml
Database:
  - analysis_sessions: Table created with 0 records initially
  - Structure: Stores video metadata, segments, analysis results
  
Files:
  - Created: components/SessionManager.tsx
  - Created: app/api/sessions/save/route.ts
  - Created: app/api/sessions/list/route.ts
  - Created: app/api/sessions/load/[id]/route.ts
  - Created: lib/supabase-upload-chunked.ts (not integrated)
  - Created: lib/video-upload-direct.ts (not integrated)
  - Created: docs/DATABASE_REQUIREMENTS.md
  - Created: docs/AI_RESEARCH_PROMPT.md
  - Modified: lib/services/chillin.ts
  - Modified: app/dashboard/page.tsx
  
Configuration:
  - Environment: All existing keys still in use
  - Database: analysis_sessions table added
  
External Services:
  - Supabase: Still in use but identified as inadequate
  - Research Result: Neon + Cloudflare R2 recommended
```

## Technical Decisions
| Question | Choice | Alternative Considered | Reasoning |
|----------|--------|------------------------|-----------|
| How to fix large uploads? | Migrate to R2 + Neon | Fix Supabase timeouts | Supabase fundamentally not designed for large files |
| Session storage approach? | Server-side with service key | Client-side with anon key | Bypass RLS complications |
| MCP requirement? | Make it mandatory | Make it optional | Need terminal integration for workflow |
| Migration target? | Neon (DB) + R2 (storage) | Appwrite, AWS S3+RDS | Best cost/performance, easiest migration |

## Project Patterns Discovered
```yaml
Naming:
  - Session files: YYYY-MM-DD-description.md
  - API routes: /api/[resource]/[action]/route.ts
  - Upload paths: uploads/video_[timestamp]_[filename]
  
Structure:
  - Session management separate from video analysis
  - Service keys for critical operations
  - Background tasks use bash sessions
  
Error Handling:
  - Return {error: string, details?: string} from APIs
  - Log full errors server-side, sanitize for client
  - Timeout large operations with status updates
  
Testing:
  - Manual testing through UI
  - Console logging for debugging
  - Test files in root (test-*.js)
```

## User Preferences Observed
```yaml
Prefers:
  - Solutions that "just work" for large files
  - MCP server integration (non-negotiable)
  - Cost under $100/month
  - Transparency about what's happening (progress bars)
  
Avoids:
  - Complex workarounds for fundamental limitations
  - Services without MCP support
  - Expensive solutions (>$200/month)
  
Communication Style:
  - Direct ("that is stupid that supabase is having issues")
  - Practical focus on real usage (5GB files)
  - Values working solutions over perfect code
```

## Environment & Dependencies
```yaml
Stack:
  - Language: TypeScript/JavaScript (Node.js)
  - Framework: Next.js 14 (App Router)
  - Database: Supabase (PostgreSQL) - to be replaced
  - Storage: Supabase Storage - to be replaced with R2
  - Key Libraries:
    - @supabase/supabase-js
    - @aws-sdk/client-s3 (for R2 compatibility)
    - react 18
    - tailwindcss

Added This Session:
  - No new packages installed yet
  - Planned: @aws-sdk/client-s3 for R2
  - Planned: @neondatabase/serverless for Neon

Services:
  - Next.js: Port 3000 - Main application
  - Supabase: Cloud - Current database/storage
  - Planned: Neon - New database
  - Planned: Cloudflare R2 - New storage
```

## Test Commands
```bash
# Test 1: Check session management
curl http://localhost:3000/api/sessions/list?userEmail=phillip@allthingsnwa.com
# Expected: {"success":true,"sessions":[],"count":0}

# Test 2: Check if table exists
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT * FROM analysis_sessions LIMIT 1;"
# Expected: Empty result with column headers

# Test 3: Test large file upload (will timeout)
# Upload any 1GB+ video through dashboard
# Expected: Timeout after ~10 minutes
```

## Next Session Setup
### Immediate Continue
```bash
# If continuing immediately, run:
cd "/Users/phildown/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/Video Editing Test/video-analysis-app"
npm run dev
# Current work: Planning migration to Neon + R2
# Next step: Set up Cloudflare R2 account
```

### TODOs with Context
1. **Set up Cloudflare R2 account and bucket**
   - Approach: Sign up at cloudflare.com, create R2 bucket
   - Files to modify: .env.local (add R2 credentials)
   - Gotchas: Need credit card, check API limits
   - Reference: https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/

2. **Set up Neon database**
   - Approach: Sign up at neon.tech, create project
   - Files to modify: Database connection strings
   - Gotchas: Check connection pooling settings
   - Reference: https://neon.tech/docs/connect/nodejs

3. **Install MCP servers**
   - Approach: npm install mcp-server-cloudflare mcp-server-neon
   - Files to modify: .mcp.json
   - Gotchas: Check compatibility with current MCP version
   - Reference: GitHub repos for each MCP server

4. **Implement R2 multipart upload**
   - Approach: Use AWS SDK v3 with R2 endpoint
   - Files to modify: lib/video-upload.ts
   - Gotchas: Different from S3 in some edge cases
   - Reference: Code example in research results

5. **Migrate database from Supabase to Neon**
   - Approach: pg_dump from Supabase, pg_restore to Neon
   - Files to modify: All database connection points
   - Gotchas: RLS policies need recreation
   - Reference: https://neon.tech/docs/import/migrate-from-supabase

## Raw Reference Data
```
# Migration recommendation from research
Platform: Neon + Cloudflare R2
Cost: ~$30/month ($15 Neon + $15 R2)
Benefits:
- Zero egress fees (saves $400+ on 5TB bandwidth)
- MCP servers available (both platforms)
- Multipart uploads for 10GB+ files
- Postgres compatibility (easy migration)
- S3-compatible API (use AWS SDK)

# R2 multipart upload code template
import { S3Client } from '@aws-sdk/client-s3';
import { Upload } from '@aws-sdk/lib-storage';

const client = new S3Client({ 
  region: 'auto', 
  endpoint: 'https://<accountid>.r2.cloudflarestorage.com',
  credentials: {
    accessKeyId: process.env.R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID,
    secretAccessKey: process.env.R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY,
  }
});

# Current failing upload
File: P1011685.MP4
Size: 1.4GB (1,412.71MB)
Timeout: After 615,709ms (10.3 minutes)
Error: UND_ERR_HEADERS_TIMEOUT
```
