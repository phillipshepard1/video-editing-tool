# Session Summary - August 14, 2025

## Quick Resume
```bash
# Commands to get back to exact working state
cd "/Users/phildown/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/Video Editing Test/video-analysis-app"
npm run dev
# Server running at: http://localhost:3000
# GitHub repo: https://github.com/phillipshepard1/video-editing-tool.git
```

## Session Context
**What was working before this session:**
- Core Gemini video analysis functionality
- Video preview with 5-second context window
- Smart filtering system with categories
- Terminal-themed UI with progress bars
- Export to EDL, FCPXML, Premiere XML formats

**What initiated this session:**
User returned with "can you look over the project and refresh yourself" - needed to review project state and fix issues with upload progress and video playback.

**Current state:**
- ‚úÖ MOV file upload to Gemini confirmed working
- ‚úÖ Upload progress bar now shows smooth animation (simulated)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è MOV file playback partially fixed (browser codec limitations)
- ‚úÖ MP4 playback fully functional
- ‚úÖ All changes pushed to GitHub
- üéØ Clustering feature planned for repeated takes

## Changes Made
| Location | What Changed | Why | How to Test |
|----------|--------------|-----|-------------|
| `app/page.tsx:96-152` | Replaced fetch with XMLHttpRequest for uploads | Track real upload progress | Upload file, watch progress bar |
| `app/page.tsx:108-119` | Added simulated progress animation | Next.js buffers prevent real tracking | Upload large file, see smooth progress |
| `app/page.tsx:337-363` | Fixed play/pause with async handling | Prevent interruption errors | Click play/pause buttons |
| `app/page.tsx:64-68` | MOV files served with MP4 MIME type | Browser compatibility | Upload MOV file, check preview |
| `app/page.tsx:781-792` | Added video error and codec debugging | Diagnose playback issues | Check console when video fails |
| `app/api/analysis/upload/route.ts:69-97` | Added upload timing logs | Monitor performance | Check server logs during upload |

## Problems & Solutions

### Issue: Upload Progress Jumping to 90%
```
Problem: Progress bar jumped from 10% directly to 90%
Root Cause: Next.js API routes buffer entire request body
```
**Tried:**
- XMLHttpRequest with progress events
- Direct progress tracking

**Solution:**
- Simulated smooth progress based on file size (estimates ~10MB/s)
- Updates every 100ms for smooth animation
- Actual completion triggers at real upload end

**Key Learning:** Next.js middleware prevents real upload progress tracking

### Issue: MOV Files Not Playing
```
Problem: Play/pause buttons don't work with MOV files
Error: video/quicktime MIME type not supported
```
**Tried:**
- Multiple source elements
- Forcing MP4 MIME type for MOV files

**Partial Solution:**
- Serve MOV files with video/mp4 MIME type
- Works if MOV uses H.264 codec
- Fails with ProRes or HEVC codecs

**Key Learning:** Browser video support is codec-dependent, not just container

### Issue: "play() request was interrupted"
```
Warning: Harmless browser warning about interrupted playback
```
**Solution:**
- Added try/catch with async play() handling
- Suppressed interruption warnings
- Real errors still logged

## New Feature Plan: Clustering for Repeated Takes

### Concept
Automatically group segments where speaker repeats the same content, allowing quick selection of best take.

### Detection Strategy
1. **Text Similarity** - Compare Gemini's transcribed reasons
2. **Temporal Proximity** - Nearby segments likely retakes
3. **Duration Similarity** - Similar length = possible retake
4. **Manual Override** - User can group/ungroup

### Proposed UI
```
Cluster: "Introduction Takes" (3 segments)
‚îå‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îê
‚îÇ ‚≠ê Best Take (0:15-0:22) [Selected] ‚îÇ
‚îÇ ‚ùå Take 2 (0:30-0:38) [Remove]     ‚îÇ
‚îÇ ‚ùå Take 3 (0:45-0:51) [Remove]     ‚îÇ
‚îÇ [Select Different] [Keep All Takes] ‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îò
```

### Implementation Plan
1. **Add Clustering Algorithm**
   ```typescript
   function clusterSegments(segments: EnhancedSegment[]) {
     // Group by similarity score
     // Consider time proximity
     // Return clustered groups
   }
   ```

2. **Create ClusterView Component**
   - Toggle between normal/clustered view
   - Show cluster cards with all takes
   - Highlight selected "best" take
   - Preview comparison view

3. **Cluster Actions**
   - Auto-select best take (highest confidence)
   - One-click "Remove all but best"
   - Manual take selection
   - Ungroup cluster

4. **Integration Points**
   - Works with existing filter system
   - Updates export to respect cluster decisions
   - Timeline shows cluster indicators

### Benefits
- Quickly handle multiple takes
- Reduce decision fatigue
- Visual comparison of options
- Bulk operations on related content

## Data/State Created
```yaml
Files:
  - Created: Session Summaries/2025-08-14-upload-progress-mov-fix-clustering-plan.md
  - Modified: app/page.tsx (upload progress, MOV handling)
  - Modified: app/api/analysis/upload/route.ts (timing logs)
  
Git:
  - Committed: "Fix upload progress bar and video playback controls"
  - Pushed to: https://github.com/phillipshepard1/video-editing-tool.git
  - Commit hash: b3d9b69
  
Issues Found:
  - Large file warning: test-video.mp4 (81MB) exceeds GitHub's 50MB recommendation
  - Consider using Git LFS for video files
```

## Technical Decisions
| Question | Choice | Alternative Considered | Reasoning |
|----------|--------|------------------------|-----------|
| Upload progress tracking | Simulated based on file size | Real XHR progress events | Next.js buffers prevent real tracking |
| MOV playback fix | Serve with MP4 MIME type | Server-side conversion | Quick fix, works for H.264 MOVs |
| Progress animation | 100ms intervals | Immediate updates | Smooth visual experience |
| Clustering detection | Text similarity + proximity | AI-based only | Hybrid approach more reliable |

## Environment & Dependencies
```yaml
Stack:
  - Framework: Next.js 15.4.6
  - Runtime: Node v22.18.0
  - UI: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
  - Video Analysis: Gemini 2.5 Pro API
  
Services:
  - Dev Server: http://localhost:3000
  - GitHub: phillipshepard1/video-editing-tool
  - API: Gemini Files API (2GB max)
  
Known Limitations:
  - MOV support depends on codec (H.264 works, ProRes doesn't)
  - Upload progress is simulated, not real
  - Next.js buffers uploads, preventing streaming
```

## Test Commands
```bash
# Test 1: Upload progress animation
# Upload any video >50MB
# Expected: Smooth progress from 20% to 85% over estimated time

# Test 2: MOV file playback
# Upload MOV with H.264 codec
# Expected: Preview plays correctly
# Upload MOV with ProRes codec
# Expected: Error in console, no playback

# Test 3: Check GitHub push
git log --oneline -5
# Expected: Shows recent commit with upload fixes

# Test 4: Verify server still running
curl http://localhost:3000
# Expected: HTML response
```

## Next Session Setup

### Immediate Continue
```bash
cd "/Users/phildown/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/Video Editing Test/video-analysis-app"
npm run dev
# Focus: Implement clustering feature for repeated takes
```

### TODOs with Context

1. **Implement Clustering Feature** ‚≠ê PRIORITY
   - Create clustering algorithm in lib/clustering.ts
   - Add ClusterView component
   - Integrate with existing segment display
   - Test with real repeated takes

2. **Fix MOV Codec Support**
   - Option 1: Server-side conversion to MP4
   - Option 2: Use video.js player with broader codec support
   - Option 3: Detect codec and show user message

3. **Optimize Upload for Large Files**
   - Consider chunked upload approach
   - Add resume capability for failed uploads
   - Show real progress using WebSockets

4. **Add Git LFS for Video Files**
   ```bash
   git lfs track "*.mp4" "*.mov"
   git add .gitattributes
   ```

5. **Export Format Fixes**
   - Fix videoFileName.replace error in export functions
   - Ensure file parameter is passed correctly

## User Preferences Observed
```yaml
Communication:
  - Likes session summaries for context preservation
  - Direct problem reporting: "just sits at 10%"
  - Tests thoroughly: Found MOV vs MP4 playback difference
  
Development Style:
  - Wants features planned before implementation
  - Values visual clustering for editing efficiency
  - Prefers GitHub for version control
  
Feature Priorities:
  1. Functional video editing workflow
  2. Handling repeated takes (new clustering request)
  3. Smooth UI/UX (progress bars, animations)
```

## Raw Reference Data
